    <h3>What is it</h3>
    <p>
        Turing machine emulator is a program that emulates a turing machine.
        It takes in a program in the form of a
        <a href="./tmi.html">.tmi file</a> and runs the program on a specified
        input.
    </p>
    <h2 id="user-guide">User guide</h2>
    <h4>How to build tm_emulator.exe</h4>
    <p>
        If you want to build the emulator, you need a compiler for C++ 17 or higher.
        Put all emulator files (every .cpp and .hpp file from project/tm_emulator directory)
        in a single directory. Then compile the program linking all <em>.cpp</em> and <em>.hpp</em> files and
        specify output to be <em>tm_emulator.exe</em>.
        For gcc's default Windows installation location, move to the directory with the emulator files and specify the following:<br>
        <code>C:\msys64\ucrt64\bin\g++.exe -g *.cpp *.hpp -o tm_emulator.exe</code><br>
        If you need further help with compiling,
        <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/how-to-compile-and-run-the-cplusplus-program">here is a guide</a>
    </p>
    <h4>How to run a turing machine program</h4>
    <p>
        Unless you have a .tmi program, you have to create one. You can use
        <a href="./tms.html">TM Script</a> to encode the instructions
        and <a href="./compiler.html">TM Compiler</a> to compile it to .tmi
        or you can directly code in .tmi, though it is arguably harder.
        <br>
        If you aready have a .tmi program, either select to open the program with
        tm_emulator.exe, or run the .exe file and specify it in the CLI or
        you can specify it in the <a href="#arguments">program arguments</a> by:<br>
        <code>tm_emulator.exe program_name_or_location.tmi (optional arguments)</code>.<br>
        If the program takes in a CLI input, it will ask you for one. If it does not, you can specify input
        and output files with program arguments as well.
        Another option is to open the tmi file with this program.
    </p>

    <h3 id="debug-mode">Debug mode</h3>
    <p>
        TM Emulator has a debug mode, that will print the tape's previous, current and
        following byte relative to the head location. It will also print the exact head
        location, current state, comment on that state, and instruction that is about to
        happen.<br>
        To enable it, either add <code>-d</code> to launch arguments.<br>
        For a line 5<code>R# 2/0 //set bit to 1 if 0, otherwise halt</code> the print could look like this:
    </p>
    <pre>
--------------------------
Surrounding bytes:
00000000 00000000 10101010
            ^
[instruction in state 5]:
action if 0/1: R/#
 state if 0/1: 2/0
      comment: //set bit to 1 if 0, otherwise halt

next action, state: R, 2
    </pre>

    <h3 id="problems">Common problems:</h3>
    <h4>Output is messed up</h4>
    <p>
        If you have trouble with the output, you should use flags to tell the emulator
        how to interpret the output correctly. By default the compiler erases null bytes
        from both sides of the tape until it finds a single non-null byte.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>If you program directly in .tmi, you can find the flags <a href="./tmi.html#flags">here</a></li>
        <li>If you program in TM Script, you can find the flags <a href="./tmi.html#flags">here</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Program terminated when it wasn't supposed to</h4>
    <p>
        This problem probably has one of these two causes:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>The program reached its iteration limit</li>
        <li>The program is incorrect</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        If you are certain the program is correct, increase or erase the iteration limit using the flags:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>#iterLimit = N</code> in TM Script</li>
        <li><code>#iterLimit=N</code> in TM Instructions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The limit is set to 100 million by default, so N has to be larger than that, or erase it completely with N = -1.<br>
        If that doesn't work, enter debug mode with launch argument <code>-d</code> in launch parameters.
        If the program is correct, and either the compiler or emulator interpreted it incorrectly, please contact project owner.
    </p>
    <h4>Input got messed up</h4>
    <p>
        You might have accidentaly turned on blank encoding. Please make sure that the
        <a href="./tmi.html#flags">blank-encoding flag</a> is turned off.
        If you did want <a href="#blank-encoding">blank encoding</a>,
        make sure you program accounts for it correctly.
        If the problem still remains, please contact project owner.
    </p>

    <h3 id="arguments">Program arguments</h3>
    <p>
        Program takes in a positional argument with the .tmi file it is to run
        like so: <code>tm_emulator.exe example.tmi</code>.
        Program also takes in multiple optional arguments.

        The core of the turing machine is entirely inside <em>tm_emulator.exe</em>.
        Anything file related (input, output, format translating) can be found
        inside of <em>file_handler.cpp</em>. Flags, data encoding and decoding, tape
        interpretation resides in <em>tm_codec.cpp</em>. All exported function have their

        <em>TuringMachine</em> class consists of all methods needed to run it. It takes in a program,
        some data, runs the machine and outputs it after halting.
        Its tape is stored in a seperate <em>Tape</em> class that stores vital information for correct
        runtime of the machine. The tape also has methods to manage itself, though they are called
        by the TuringMachine class on iteration if needed. Thus the machine itself takes care of the tape,
        and the Tape class essentially exists just to make the enormous TuringMachine class somewhat smaller.
        Because of tapes dynamic size, it unfortunately cannot get stored on the stack.
        Instruction encoding is the same as <a href="./tmi.html#instruction-encoding">.tmi's instructions</a>.

    <h4>Encoding</h4>
    <p>
        When the emulator gets input, it is passed to the codec. The codec also gets
        <a href="./tmi.html#flags">flags</a> that are parsed from the instruction file.
        Using these flags, it encodes the data accordingly and returns it back to the
        emulator, which will pass it directly to the TuringMachine.
    </p>
    <h4>Decoding</h4>
    <p>
        When the emulator gets the machine's output, it is passed to the codec. The codec also gets
        <a href="./tmi.html#flags">flags</a> that were parsed from the instruction file.
        Using these flags, it decodes the data as desired by the program and returns it back to the
        emulator, which will decide where to put it.
    </p>
    <h4 id="blank-encoding">Blank encoding</h4>
    <p>
        Turing machine emulator allows for encoding a seperate blank symbol from
        0 or 1. It has no additional support in the compiler (or TM script), other than 
        <a href="./tms.html#flags">being a flag</a>. The codec encodes each bit as following:
    </p>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Original</th>
                <th>Encoded as</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>0</td>
                <td>10</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>11</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>blank</td>
                <td>00</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>undefined symbol (optional)</td>
                <td>01</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
        If you desire another symbol on the tape that has nothing to do with actual data on the tape
        you can interpret 01 symbol as you please. Just beware that it is considered undefined
        behavior. It will not crash the program in any way, but may cause decoding issues.
        I suggest using these combined with blank as flags (where blank is 0, the other is 1).
        This allows for 2 pow n flags in 2n tape cells.
    </p>
    <p>
        When a tape is expanded, it gets automatically expanded to blank symbols. The tape accounts
        for the fact that the tape it is blank encoded and expands in even number of bytes.
        When the codec gets the data from the tape, it assumes that each byte starts on an even index
        (starting with 0) and ends on a odd index. The even part of the byte is the more significant half.
        The codec also assumes that any non-blank byte is a valid byte, meaning that if it has at least a single
        valid bit, it will be the starting/ending point for decoding.
    </p>
    <h3 id="file_handler.cpp">file_handler.cpp</h3>
    <p>
        It handles all file input, output and translation needed for the machine and codec to process
        it. If you want to expand the machine to be able to process more formats than binary and txt,
        this is the place where to put your code.
